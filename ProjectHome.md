### Ad Auction Agents Workshop - TAU Fall 2010/11 ###

Each group of students will implement a trading agent to compete in an Ad-Auction simulation, using the server infrastructure of the Trading Agents Competition on Ad Auctions to simulate populations of users and a publisher ad auction platform. The trading agents by the students will compete to achieve the highest profit by implementing machine learning algorithms to best model the environment (e.g. users preferences, and competing agents behavior) and optimize related actions and decisions (e.g. bids on search keywords).

The Trading Agents implemented will conform to a predefined modular partition. Different implementations of modules by different teams may be interchanged, implying that the performance of alternative implementations of a module may be compared. Moreover, modules from different teams may be  combined to create fully competitive agents that may take part in upcoming trading agents competitions.
